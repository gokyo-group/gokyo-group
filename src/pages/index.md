  For us, Green is not specific to environmental greenery; GIRC relates the word green to food, shelter,
  health, culture, peace and development. For this reason our NGO, in addition to plantation &
  environmental awareness activities, is involved in Education, Food &
  clothes distribution, and awareness+community empowerment projects.

        Participatory processes enable people to identify and prioritize their concerns, make
        choices and agree on solutions, prepare development plans and strategies for
        implementation, contribute resources and share in the maintenance of facilities. GREEN
        uses participatory tools like resource mapping, social mapping, problem tree, matrix ,etc,
        to generate real information from people and create infrastructure that is sustainable for
        society in the long run.

        The processes of community engagement produces social change by creating solidarity,
        commitment, mutuality and trust. It builds place attachment, by getting communities
        involved and taking pride, in the improvement of their own neighborhoods. By
        nurturing a sense of belonging and positive social interactions and institutions,
        community processes create equality in an unequal society and make people capable
        and resilient. GREEN's major concern is to build resilient society by using local and
        economy technology in the community.

  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
